# Face-Emotional-Analysis
<img src="Herta-bioobserver-facial-analysis (3).jpg">
This repository contains a Python project that can be used to detect facial emotions. The project uses the MediaPipe face mesh API to detect face landmarks, and a simple multilayer perceptron to recognize facial emotions from the detected landmarks.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository is condisered asone of the top computer vision projects that can be used to analysis facial emotions. The project uses the mediapipe tool, which is a publicly available tool of facial analysis. The project also uses the Keras deep learning library to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect facial emotions.

### This repository contains the following contents

- Simple Python programs
- Facial emotion recognition machine learning model(TFLite)
- Script for collect data from images dataset and camera

# Prerequisites

- python
- mediapipe
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
